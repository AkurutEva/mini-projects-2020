# Reproduce genomic analysis

## Background

During this residential training, you will acquire skills in high throughput sequence analysis, the use of reproducible genomic workflows and download data using APIs. Through this mini-project, you will get to solidify and consolidate the skills you will have acquired. 

## Abstract




---

## Your Task
The study uses several genomic and Bioinformatics approaches. In this project, you are required to reproduce the genomic analysis carried out in the study. The data is available from NCBI. You are expected to:
1. Download the sequence data programmatically using an API


## Questions
In your report, you should address the following question:
- Are you able to arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper? Why or why not? 
- What else can you glean from your re-analysis?
- Are the descriptions in the methodology section detailed for reproducibility? If not, what could you have done to improve reproducibility?
