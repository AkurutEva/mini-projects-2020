# EANBiT 2020 Virtual Residential Training Mini-Projects

Mini-projects for the residential training. As part of the EANBiT Residential training 2020, you will collaboratively work on mini-projects in groups of at least 5. 

## Projects
1. [Project 1: Reproduce Published ONT pipeline](reproduce_Published_ONT_pipeline.md)
2. [Project 2: Genomic characterisation of Escherichia coli isolates from rural drinking water systems](Genomic_characterisation_of_Escherichia_coli_isolates_from_rural_drinking_water_systems.md)
3. [Project 3: Interrogating public datasets and paths to results on Covid19 in East Africa](Interrogating_public_datasets_and_paths_to_results_on_Covid19.md)
4. [Project 4: Origin of antimicrobial resistance Escherichia coli isolates in a Pastoralist Community using Whole genome sequences data](Origin_of_antimicrobial_resistance_Escherichia_coli_isolates.md)
5. [Project 5: RNA-Seq data processing and gene expression analysis workflow](RNA-Seq_workflow.md)
6. [Project 6: Variant calling from NGS data of two accessions of Lablab purpureus](Variant_calling_from_NGS_data_Lablab_purpureus.md)

## Expected
- Work collaboratively on the project. In your report, you need to state the role played by each group member.
- Collaborate via Git & GitHub, making use of the Git Workflow.
- Assign tasks to group members using GitHub issues **and** learn from each other. Every member of the group must be knowledgeable of the work of the whole group.
- Your submission should be accompanied by a reproducible workflow implemented using the workflow languages you were taught during the training.
- Document your scripts in a nice and informative way. Your scripts, programs, workflows, etc, will be reviewed as a critical part of the project assessment.
- Your writeup should be complete with visualizations.
