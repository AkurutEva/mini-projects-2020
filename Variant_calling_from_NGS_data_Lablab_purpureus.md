# Variant calling from NGS data of two accessions of Lablab purpureus

Lablab purpureus is a bean (family Fabaceae) commonly known as “lablab” which is native to Africa and widely cultivated in East Africa. It is called “Njahi” or black beans in Kenya where it is an important part of the daily diet. Lablab is, however, still an orphan crop with limited genomics and genetics resources. Recently, three genomes assemblies were separately created for two lablab accessions by the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC) and ILRI (Feed and Forage Development program and Bioinformatics Community of Practice). These include an Illumina-based and an Oxford Nanopore-based assemblies for accession 147D, and a nanopore-based assembly for accession 147X. These assemblies can be used as templates for identifying molecular markers to fast-track the genetic mapping of economically important traits in lablab. 
The raw sequence data used for these assemblies will be made available to you for use in this project. Using these sequences, you will:
1. Re-assemble the genomes for the two accessions to obtain an Illumina-based, nanopore-based and hybrid assembly. 
2. Perform variant calling between accessions 147D and X using:

    a. Accession 147D Illumina-based assembly as reference.
    
    b. Accession 147D Nanopore-based assembly as a reference
3. Compare the variant calling metrics (e.g. number of SNP, quality of SNP) from (a) and (b) above. 
4. Try and assess the presence of larger structural variants (by contrast with SNPs) thanks to the long-read, Nanopore-based assembly.
